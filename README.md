### Features

- Kerbals require resources to survive whether in a vessel or on EVA: Food, Water, Oxygen, Electricity (for air quality and climate control)
- They produce waste resources: CarbonDioxide, Waste, WasteWater
- They will die if they go without resources for too long: 30 days without food, 3 days without water, 2 hours without Oxygen, and 2 hours without Electricity
- Crewed pods come stocked with 3 days of resources.
- When a Kerbal goes on EVA, he takes a half day of each resource with him in the EVA suit, taking from the pod that he was in.
- Kerbals do require resources even when their vessel is not active, and they can die if you leave them alone for too long.
- The system tries to stop Time Warp when resources get low and again when resources run out. No guarantees.
- Includes Hex Can containers for Food, Water, and Oxygen.


### How to use

Make sure that you pack enough supplies when sending manned missions. Use recyclers to extend the range. Watch the Life Support Monitoring window to see when your ships are estimated to run out.


### Installation procedure

1. Copy everything in the GameData directory to the {KSP}/GameData directory.
