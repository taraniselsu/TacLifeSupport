### Features

- Kerbals require resources to survive whether in a vessel or on EVA: Food, Water, Oxygen, Electricity (for air quality and climate control)
- They produce waste resources: CarbonDioxide, Waste, WasteWater
- They will die if they go without resources for too long: 30 days without food, 3 days without water, 5 minutes without Oxygen, and 2 hours without Electricity
- Crewed pods come stocked with 3 days of resources.
- When a Kerbal goes on EVA, he takes a half day of each resource with him in the EVA suit, taking from the pod that he was in.
- Kerbals do require resources even when their vessel is not active, and they can die if you leave them alone for too long.
- The system tries to stop Time Warp when resources get low and again when resources run out. No guarantees.
- Includes Hex Can containers for Food, Water, and Oxygen.
